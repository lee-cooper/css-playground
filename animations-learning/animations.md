# CSS Animations

From [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations]()

- Animates transitions from one CSS style configuration to another
- Consists of two components
  1. A style describing the CSS animation
  2. Set of keyframes that signal the start and end states of the animation's styles, along with any significant keyframes along the way

The animation property lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of the animation: (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) for full list)

## Keyframes

Keyframes use a percentage to indicate the time during the animation sequence at which they take place

- 0% is the start (aka from)
- 100% is the end (aka to)
